# Spatial Nav Demo

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

A minimal PICO Spatial SDK app showing how to navigate between multiple 3D panels inside a single spatial window, including a panel that embeds a live 3D model.

## What it does

Three panels wired together with Jetpack Navigation Compose:

- **Hub** — a collaboration board with three sticky notes. Tapping any note opens Board A.
- **Board A** — a resource panel that embeds an animated 3D robot (`SpatialView`). It can move forward to Board B or close back to the Hub.
- **Board B** — a text resource panel that closes back to the Hub.

```
Hub ──tap note──▶ Board A ──continue──▶ Board B
 ▲                   │                     │
 └──────close────────┴─────────close───────┘
```

## Tech stack

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- PICO Spatial SDK 0.12.2 (`SpatialView`, `DefaultWindowContainer`, ECS entities)
- Jetpack Navigation Compose for in-window routing
- Single Gradle module (`:app`), package `com.example.spatialnav`, `arm64-v8a`, `minSdk 26`

## Project structure

```txt
app/src/main/java/com/example/spatialnav/
├── Main.kt                         # Entry: DefaultWindowContainer + NavHost (3 routes)
├── platform/
│   ├── SpatialApplication.kt       # launch(::mainApp)
│   └── LaunchActivity.kt           # SpatialLaunchActivity
├── ui/
│   ├── demo/
│   │   └── DemoScreens.kt          # Hub / Board A / Board B + Robot3DView + Routes
│   └── skeletal/
│       └── SkeletalAnimationViewModel.kt  # Owns the robot Entity, cleans up in onCleared
├── util/
│   └── SkeletalAnimationUtil.kt    # Loads the robot model, plays skeletal clips
└── data/
    └── AnimationModels.kt          # SkeletalAnimationState (clip indices)
app/src/main/assets/
└── pico_robot_animated.glb         # The 3D model shown on Board A
```

The navigation lives in `Main.kt`; each panel is a Composable in `ui/demo/DemoScreens.kt`. The 3D model is loaded by `SkeletalAnimationViewModel` (in `ui/skeletal/`), which is scoped to Board A's back stack entry, so leaving the panel cleans up the model automatically.

## Requirements

Set up your environment per the official PICO Spatial SDK guide:

- [Setup Guide (Outside Chinese Mainland)](https://developer.picoxr.com/document/spatial-sdk/set-up-development-environment/)
- [Setup Guide (Chinese Mainland)](https://developer-cn.picoxr.com/document/spatial-sdk/set-up-development-environment/)

JDK 11+ is required (the project is verified with the JDK 17 bundled in Android Studio's JBR).

## Run

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Create a PICO Emulator via **Device Manager**, or connect a PICO device with USB debugging enabled.
3. Click **Run 'app'**.

## Swap the 3D model

1. Drop your animated `.glb` into `app/src/main/assets/`.
2. Update `ANIMATED_ROBOT` and the clip count in `util/SkeletalAnimationUtil.kt` and `data/AnimationModels.kt`.
